# ecg-grammars

This repository is intended to be a base for ECG grammar development and distribution. At the moment - and in the foreseeable future - it contains only the grammar files themselves, associated ontologies, and preferences files. In other words, the tools to do something with the grammar (Workbench, Analyzer JAR file) are distributed separately.

To view and run the grammar in the ECG Workbench, clone <a href=https://github.com/icsi-berkeley/workbench-release>this repo</a> and open the version that corresponds to your operating system.

To run the grammar in Terminal to view resulting n-tuples from input utterances, see <a href=https://github.com/icsi-berkeley/framework-code>this repository</a>.

Also, some grammars may exist in their entirety on their own branch rather than the master branch (e.g. hesperian) because they require slight modifications to the core grammar.
