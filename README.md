# ecg-grammars

This repository is intended to be a base for ECG grammar development and distribution. At the moment - and in the foreseeable future - it contains only the grammar files themselves, associated ontologies, and preferences files. In other words, the tools to do something with the grammar (Workbench, Analyzer JAR file) are distributed separately.

To run the compositional robot grammar in a robot demo, see this repository: https://github.com/icsi-berkeley/full-path
